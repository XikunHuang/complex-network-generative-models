  He writes a Complex Networks Package for MatLab.

  The Complex Networks Package for MatLab comes to provide a comprehansive, efficient, and expandable framework for network research and education in MatLab. It can help characterising empirical networks of dosens of millions of nodes, generating artificial networks, running robusteness experiments, testing the resilience of networks to different attacks, simulating arbitrarily complex contagion in the context of epidemiology, marketing or social media, and generating nice network layouts and even movies representing processes on networks or network evolution.
