1.  [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/)
    
    a general purpose network analysis and graph mining library
    
1.  [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/)
 
    analysis and visualization of large networks. 
    
1.  [NetworKit](https://networkit.iti.kit.edu/index.html)
    
    aims to provide tools for the analysis of large networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges
    
    it provides graph generators that produce synthetic networks according to various models:
    
        - ER model
        - BA model
        - Watts-Strogatz model
        - Forest fire model
        - Dorogovtsev-Mendes model
        - Chung-Lu generative model which will produce a random graph with the same expected degree sequence
        - Clustered random graph
        - Random simple graph with exactly the given degree sequence
        - Havel-Hakimi algorithm for generating a graph according to a given degree sequence
        - Hyperbolic generator
        - LFR clustered graph generator
        - Generates a powerlaw degree sequence with the given minimum and maximum degree, the powerlaw exponent gamma
        - Generates a static graph that resembles an assumed geometric distribution of nodes in a P2P network 
        - Constructs a regular ring lattice
        - Generates static R-MAT graphs
